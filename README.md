This repository contains a series of small notebooks that shows my solution for the projects at [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). The following notebooks are provided:

1. KNN Regression applied to an automobile dataset to predict prices
2. Linear Regression applied to an house sales dataset to predict prices
3. Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest applied to a bike rentals dataset to predict the total number of bikes rented
